CLUSTERING PROJECT:

COLLEGE DATA PROJECT:
 This project implements K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group data points into distinct clusters based on similarity. The algorithm aims to partition data into K clusters, where each cluster is represented by its centroid.
